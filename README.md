# VisionTag
This uses AI vision to do hit detection for a system similar to laser tag.

The main_inferencing program does the hit detection and saves the results as well as displays them, the server program recieves the images and sends out the player information, and the gun program runs on the raspberry pi's that I use to take the images, make the sounds, and send the data. This is a short youtube video explaining and showing it working: https://youtu.be/hf8q6g-rpvM.
